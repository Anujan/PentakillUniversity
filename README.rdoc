== Pentakill University is the application that is run on [TheProvingGrounds.net](http://theprovinggrounds.net).

You guys are free to do whatever with the code, even rehosting it if you'd like. 

It's a mentorship system for League of Legends and allows mentors to track games of students and provide feedback.

Disclaimer: The site was made at the early stages when I was learning Ruby on Rails so there is a lot that could be changed to be better. Unfortunately, I am not interested in this project anymore and will not continue to put my time into it.
